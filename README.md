- Dataset includes six worksheets:  
  - **Places** (fact table)  
  - **Hosts, Neighborhood** (dimension tables)  
- Ensured **data type integrity** across all columns  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Modeling

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Developed Key Dax Measures 
**Total Hosts** = COUNT(Host[Year Joined])
**Total Superhost** = CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Host[Year Joined]),
    Host[Superhost] = "Yes")
**Superhost %** = DIVIDE([Total Superhost], [Total Hosts])
**Total Neighbourhood** = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Neighbourhood[Neighborhood]))
**Price per guest** = DIVIDE(
    SUM(Place[Price]),
    SUM(Place[Accommodates]))
**Average Rating** = AVERAGE(
    Place[Rating])

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
